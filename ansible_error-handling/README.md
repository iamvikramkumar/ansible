# Ansible Error Handling 

In Ansible, when a particular command or module returns a zero code, the command is successfully executed without any failure. If there is a non-zero code, which means this is a command failure, it will stop the execution on that particular host and continue on the other host.


It refers to the mechanisms and strategies used to manage and respond to errors that occur during the execution of Ansible playbooks, roles, or tasks.

# Ansible provides several ways to handle errors, including:

1. ignore_errors: A keyword that allows you to ignore specific errors and continue with the playbook execution.
2. failed_when: A keyword that allows you to specify conditions under which a task is considered failed.
3. block: A keyword that allows you to group tasks and manage errors at the block level.
4. rescue: A keyword that allows you to define a rescue block to handle errors.
5. always: A keyword that allows you to define a task that always runs, regardless of errors.
6. error handling: A built-in mechanism that allows you to define custom error handling routines.

# Best practices for Ansible error handling include:

1. Anticipate errors: Expect errors to happen and plan accordingly.
2. Use verbose logging: Enable verbose logging to get detailed error messages.
3. Use debug mode: Run Ansible in debug mode to get more detailed information about errors.
4. Test and validate: Thoroughly test and validate your playbooks to catch errors before they become critical.
5. Handle errors explicitly: Use Ansible's error handling mechanisms to explicitly handle errors, rather than relying on default behavior.

By implementing effective error handling strategies, you can make your Ansible playbooks more robust, reliable, and efficient.
